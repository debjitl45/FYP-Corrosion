# Corrosion Rate Prediction using Machine Learning
Welcome to the repository for the final year project in BTech, "Investigating the Relative Influence of Various Factors on Corrosion Rate using Machine Learning Techniques."

## Project Overview
Corrosion is a critical issue in various industries, affecting the structural integrity and lifespan of materials. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict and understand the relative influence of different factors on the corrosion rate. By analyzing these factors, we can develop models that enhance corrosion rate predictions and contribute to more effective corrosion prevention strategies.

## Features
